1) Web browsers function by a user inputting an address into the interface (specifically the URL). From there, the interface interacts with the browser engine to communicate with the rendering engine,
   which displays the requested information based on the language that the engine is pulling the information from (i.e. HTML, CSS) as well as file formats like PDF. The rendering engine that is used is
   dependent on the type of web browser being used, but they all roughly behave in the same way.
2) DOM is shorthand for Document Object Model. It's an API that is used for document manipulation (such as HTML, XML, etc). The information is organized by the method of using a DOM Tree. DOM trees can
   be modified, built from scratch, or manipulated.
3) The main difference between HTML and XHTML is that XHTML is more flexible than HTML with different types of data formats. XHTML is also much more strict with rules. For example, a DOCTYPE is always mandatory,
   and elements must always be properly nested, closed, and lowercase. XML carries information, and HTML displays information.
4) The 4 mandatory elements are DOCTYPE, html, head, title, and body.
5) Index.html is a file that basically serves as the homepage for most websites.
6) The best naming practices involve having clear, informative variable names with helpful comments to describe what said variable does.
